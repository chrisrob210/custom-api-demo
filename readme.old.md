## Repo API
#### API Basics
1. Place all controller files into a folder called `controllers` inside project folder.
2. Create a file called `routes.php`  in the project folder and place all routes inside a returned array.
3. When done, place project folder inside `api.acemart.net` folder. 
4. The API will automatically add the routes to the Router's route list and 'require' all controller class files.


#### Controllers
All controllers must be placed within the `controllers` folder inside the folder along with the routes.php file.
see `example` folder.
